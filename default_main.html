<h2>Welcome to GENtle V2!</h2>
<p>To get started, load one or more DNA sequences. In the sidebar to the left, you can open files from disk, drag files from disk onto the drop area, or load a sequence from NCBI via an NCBI ID. Currently, GenBank, FASTA, and plain text file formats are supported.</p>
<p>Once a sequence is loaded, you can edit it by double-clicking on a base. <tt>Esc</tt> will end editing. In the left sidebar, you will have several display options, and in the right sidebar will be functions such as in-sequence search.</p>
<p>Also, you can then manage plugins (see upper right corner), and even add/remove third-party plugins from the web or your own hard disk!</p>
<p>When you leave this page, or close the tab or your browser window, all plugins, sequences, settings, and your changes will be stored in your browser, and reappear the next time you visit this page.</p>
<p>You can get more information <a target='_blank' href='help.html'>here</a>.</p>
